It's our group project about podcast clustering in STAT 628 Mod4. We're group 16 with member Kangxin Zheng and Tianyu Yao.

This respiratory contains data fold, image fold, code fold, summary.pdf and readme.txt.

Data fold: podcast_episode.csv, podcast_episode_clean.csv

Image fold: Perplexity.png, Average Topic Distribution.png, PCA of LDA Topic Distribution.png

Code fold: Data cleaning.ipynb, Modeling.ipynb, app.R

Shiny link: https://tianyuyty.shinyapps.io/628-mod4-SpotifyPodcast/

Notes: The data in data fold is extrated from the first part of Data cleaning.ipynb. You can use podcast_episode.csv as the input to check the data cleaning part. After that, you can use podcast_episode_clean.csv to as the input of Modeling.ipynb to check the remaining code.
